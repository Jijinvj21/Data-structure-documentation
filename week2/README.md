## Sorting

Sorting in data structures refers to the process of arranging elements in a specific order

- Bubble Sort
    
    Compare adjacent elements in the array and swap the positions if they are not in the intended order
    
    Repeat the instruction as you step through each element in the array
    
    Once you step through the whole array with no swaps the array is sorted
    
    ### Advantages
    
    - Bubble sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms to understand and implement
    - Bubble sort operates in place, meaning it doesn't require additional memory to sort the elements. It only needs a single additional variable to hold a temporary value during the swapping process. This can be advantageous when memory usage is a concern.
    - Bubble sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements. If two elements have the same value, their order will remain the same after sorting. This can be important when sorting objects or records with multiple key attributes.
    - the big O this bubble sort is O(n) in bet case and O(n^2) in worst case
- Insertion Sort
